        The [[[RFC7049]]] [[RFC7049]] is a data format for constrained environments.
        It is designed to be processable with small code, and to produce small messages.
        Its underlying data model is an extension of the
        <a data-cite="RFC8259#" data-no-xref="">JSON</a> data model [[RFC8259]].
        That makes it an possible format to transport JSON-LD documents,
        in constrained contexts such as, e.g., the Web of Things.
        It also allows JSON-LD <a data-cite="JSON-LD11#dfn-context">contexts</a> to be used to provide a layer of semantics on existing CBOR data.
      </p>
      <p>
        More specifically, this note specifies how to convert between the
        <a data-cite="RFC7049#">CBOR</a> data format and the
        <a href="JSON-LD11#dfn-internal-representation">JSON-LD internal representation</a>
        (a is straightforward abstraction of the JSON format<span style="display: none">
          using the following terms,
          which are only included here to please ReSpec, but should not be displayed:

          <dfn data-cite="INFRA#javascript-string" class="preserve">string</dfn>
        </span>).
        Since CBOR emphasizes small messages,
        we also propose a number of techniques for reducing the size of messages.

      <p>
        To understand this note you must be familiar both the 
        <a data-cite="RFC8259" data-no-xref="">JSON</a> format [[RFC8259]] and the
        <a data-cite="RFC7049" data-no-xref="">CBOR</a> format [[RFC7049]].
        You must also understand the basics of 
        <a data-cite="JSON-LD11" data-no-xref="">JSON-LD 1.1</a> [[JSON-LD11]].

    <h2>Serializing JSON-LD to CBOR</h2>
    <p>While being generally based on the
      <a data-cite="RFC8259#">JSON</a> data model,
      the <a data-cite="RFC7049#">CBOR</a>
      specification does not specify a standard conversion between both models.
      This is due in part to the fact that the
      <a data-cite="RFC7049#">CBOR</a> model is an extension of the former.
      In this section, we provide a complete specification of such a conversion,
      following the guidelines from <a data-cite="RFC7049#section-4.2">§4.2 of RFC7049</a>,
      and taking into account the particularities of <a data-cite="JSON-LD11#">JSON-LD</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li id="serialize-null-bool">
        <a>Null</a> and <a>boolean</a> values are serialized with major type 7,
        and additional type value 22 for `null`, 20 for `false` and 21 for `true`.
      </li>
      <li id="serialize-int">
        <a>Numbers</a> without a fractional part (integer numbers)
        are serialized as CBOR integers (major types 0 and 1),
        choosing the shortest form.
      </li>
      <li id="serialize-float">
        <a>Numbers</a> with a fractional part are serialized as CBOR floating-point values
        (major type 7, and additional type value from 25 to 27). 
        Preferably,
        the shortest exact floating-point representation is used;
        for instance, 1.5 is represented in a 16-bit floating-point value
        (not all implementations will be capable of efficiently finding the minimum form, though).
      </li>
      <li id="serialize-string">
        <a>Strings</a> are serialized as CBOR UTF-8 strings
        (major type 3).
        Note that, unlike JSON,
        CBOR does not require any escaping in strings,
        so all escape codes (if any)
        present in the JSON source must be replaced beforehand by their corresponding character.
      </li>
      <li id="serialize-array">
        <a>Arrays</a> are serialized as CBOR arrays (major type 4),
        and their items are serialized by applying these rules recursively.
      </li>
      <li id="serialize-object">
        <a data-cite="RFC8259#section-4">JSON objects</a>,
        are internally represented as <a>maps</a> in JSON-LD,
        and are generally serialized as CBOR maps (major type 5).
        All keys are strings, and are serialized as above;
        all values are serialized by applying these rules recursively.
        There are however a few exceptions described below,
        to take into account their specific meaning in JSON-LD:
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the object is a
            <a data-cite="JSON-LD11#dfn-value-object">value object</a>
            with a `@type` of `xsd:integer` (TODO full IRI),
            an if its `@value` is a valid decimal representation of an integer,
            then the object is serialized as a CBOR integer (major type 0 or 1)
            choosing the shortest form.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the object is a
            <a data-cite="JSON-LD11#dfn-value-object">value object</a>
            with a `@type` of `xsd:base64Binary` (TODO full IRI),
            an if its `@value` complies with the 
            <a data-cite="XSD#base64Binary">lexical space</a>
            of `xsd:base64Binary` (i.e. is it a valid base 64 string [[RFC3548]]),
            then the JSON object is serialized as a CBOR binary string
            (major type 2) representing the decoded value.
          </li>
        </ul>


        <!--

    <h2>Parsing CBOR to JSON-LD</h2>
    <p>
      This section describes how to parse CBOR data into the

      following the guidelines from <a data-cite="RFC7049#section-4.1">§4.1 of RFC7049</a>.

        A data item with major type 0 or 1 (positive or negative integer, respectively)
        is parsed as the equivalent <a>number</a>.
        If the size of this number exceeds the size supported by the implementation,
        a parser must produce instead a <a>map</a> with two entries:
        <ul>
          <li>a `@type` entry whose value is `xsd:integer` (TODO full IRI),</li>

        A data item with major type 5 (map) is parsed as a <a>map</a>,

        A data item with major type 6 (semantic tag) is generally ignored;
